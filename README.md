# -Enhancing-Name-Gender-Classification-in-NLP-A-Naive-Bayes-Approach

🌟 Developed a Name Gender Classifier using Naive Bayes to predict the gender of names.
🔍 Utilized feature engineering techniques for improved accuracy, incorporating first and last letters, name length, contextual character combinations, and handling unisex names.
🔧 Employed a systematic approach including data splitting, iterative improvement, error analysis, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
🎯 Achieved an impressive 78% accuracy on both the dev-test set and a separate test set, highlighting the classifier's effectiveness.
💡 Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, adept data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, and rigorous model evaluation techniques.
🤝 Collaborated seamlessly with peers, effectively translating theoretical knowledge into real-world text classification challenges.
