# -Enhancing-Name-Gender-Classification-in-NLP-A-Naive-Bayes-Approach

 Developed a Name Gender Classifier using Naive Bayes to predict the gender of names.
• Utilized feature engineering techniques to improve classifier accuracy by incorporating features like first and last letters, name length, contextual character combinations, and handling unisex names.
• Employed a systematic approach of data splitting, iterative improvement, error analysis, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
• Achieved 78% accuracy on the dev-test set and 78% accuracy on the separate test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the classifier.
• Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.
• Collaborated effectively with peers and applied theoretical knowledge to real-world text classification challenges.• Developed a Name Gender Classifier using Naive Bayes to predict the gender of names. • Utilized feature engineering techniques to improve classifier accuracy by incorporating features like first and last letters, name length, contextual character combinations, and handling unisex names. • Employed a systematic approach of data splitting, iterative improvement, error analysis, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance. • Achieved 78% accuracy on the dev-test set and 78% accuracy on the separate test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the classifier. • Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques. • Collaborated effectively with peers and applied theoretical knowledge to real-world text classification challenges.
